We have created a 2D adventure game using Unity (version 5.2.2f1).



About the Game:
This 2D adventure begins with a man waking up in a cave. He exits the cave and follows the path trying 
to get home. Along the way he meets creatures who would harm him, soldiers who vaguely recognise him and
maybe more, if he chooses the right path.


**SpoilersBelow**

The man in question is a prince who's castle has been taken by a demon. As you approach the castle
the soldiers recognise you as the prince and warn you to stay back. 
Once reaching the castle entrance the player will find a demon standing at the gate.
Defeating him will end the game.

There's two paths you can take, one is longer (The right path)but brings you past a cave housing a golem who
gifts you a sword. In our current version the sword is only aesthetic but in future versions
we hope to make it more powerful, rewarding the player for exploring.

Why 2D?:
We decided on a 2D game as we felt we could create a more fun and, likely, a better looking game, 
especially considering our lack of experience with Unity and C#. We hoped this would allow us
to focus more on game mechanics and less on 3D animations (although even 2D animations can 
take a lot of time).



Challenges + What we learned:
We faced a number of challenges in the form of learning to use GitHub as a group and needing 
to learn C# and the various ways to control different aspects of the game using the game engine. 
We have come a long way since beginning our assinment, even looking back at earlier scripts I
find myself wondering what i was doing and wonder why all my comments were wrong.

Differing styles in writing code was certainly a challenge, naming schemes and use of 
comments differed between us but we got used to it as we went on.
We were worried about branching and merging at the beginning so we ended up taking turns working 
on the assignment. This proved far slower and we eventually had to try branching. Once that was 
accessible for us it sped up the process unbelievably.
Differing versions of Unity caused a scare in the middle of the assignment but it
proved to be only a minor set back.


We all did some research into how to use Unity before hand but there is a considerable
depth to the game engine and even as we neareed the end of the assignment we wwere still
learning. 
We also managed to pick up C#. This was a surprise as we all found our ability to write code
without using the Unity API as we neared the end as rather astounding. 



Creating the Assignment:
We used a program called 'Tiled' to create the maps and then 'Tiled2Unity' to import them.
This gave us some really nice maps which had collisions we had set up in tiled, already rendered 
on them and was a great starting point for us. We used art assets found online including from the 
LPC(Liberated Pixel Cup). None of us are great artists so this seemed like the best thing to do.



Final Thoughts:
I'm glad we chose to do a game in Unity. We originally thought we would create a game in 
processing but we decided to do Unity instead, which set us back a considerable amount of time.
As the assignment progressed it become enjoyable to work on it, taking priority over other 
assignments purely because it was interesting and fun. It let us be creative and although
we were often gated by inexperience that didn't stop us trying.

I'd like to continue working on the game even after it's submission and try make it the game
we had in mind when we started.
